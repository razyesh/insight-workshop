About the program

IW Academy was founded on the conviction that top software talent can be developed anywhere. By combining practical curriculum with experienced practitioners from Kathmandu, Silicon Valley & Europe, we prepare all-rounded developers in Nepal who can be part of high-performing distributed engineering teams globally.
Software engineering requires more than just knowing how to code - itâ€™s about building solutions that make a difference. Over the 12-week program, developers learn not only to code like a professional but also to think and solve problems like a leader.

Our class size is small and supplemented with team collaborations, interactive labs, guest lectures, and real-world problem-solving exercises. Students get to complete modules with an array of small/medium projects following by a final capstone product. Upon graduation, our students will be ready to start their career as software engineers with best-in-class technical and professional skills.
